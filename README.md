This repository corresponds to the package `FinalProject6`, which was prepared for the course STAT 6210 during the Fall 2024 semester.The package contains functions to implement supervised binary classification using numerical optimization, including functions to run logistic regression and output initial and optimized $β$ coefficient vectors, run a bootstrap procedure to obtain confidence intervals and boxplots for $β$, and report performance metrics of logistic regression given a $β$
 vector.
 
The package functions are:

* `logistic_regression`
* `confusion_metrics`
* `bootstrapping`
* `graphci`
